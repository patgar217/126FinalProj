# App√©tit Bar and Restaurant
This is a demo restaurant web application created as a final 
project requirement for CMSC 126. 

The application was created using PHP, SQL, and Bootstrap. The
webpage aims to mimic the restaurant menu wherein the admin could
also access the history of orders.

P.S. I uploaded the project after it was already submitted which is why there
are only a few commits created.
